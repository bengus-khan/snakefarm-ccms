# README
# This script manages PNG optimization for the techdocs system.
# It monitors the PNG unprocessed directory for file changes and uses optipng to optimize PNG filesize, creating an optimized version of each uploaded PNG in the optimized directory.
# The script also maintains the optimized directory, ensuring file name changes, file deletions/removals, and file overwrites in the unprocessed directory are reflected in the optimized directory.
# Setting this script up as a service on the techdocs server makes it possible for authors to upload unoptimized PNGs for use in documents and seamlessly use optimized versions in rendered documents, cutting down on file size.

GENERAL DEV NOTES
- Explore possibility of adding --nobanner argument to wall command in WallHandler object. Haven't implemented yet because this requires use of sudo privileges, which generally should be avoided when writing scripts.
- Evaluate script for error handling needs - both for script execution and for optipng errors. Need to set up warning/error log messages when error states arise.
- File 'optipng-bot.service' is not added to /etc/systemd/system/ yet - test script and ensure necessary permissions are set before adding service.
- Play around with optimization settings for optipng. See how much file size reduction you can accomplish without hurting overall CPU responsiveness or optimization speed.

SERVICE/CLI DEV NOTES
- Implement basic IPC between background event handling and CLI-invoked reinitialization using D-Bus
    - Modify event handler class
        - Move 'reinit' method from CLI class to event handler class
        - Register handler as a D-Bus service
        - Expose 'reinit' method so CLI user can call it over D-Bus
        - Send D-Bus signals back to CLI at various stages of task progression to enable direct console stream
            - May require tweaks to logger handlers
    - Modify CLI class
        - CLI should send method calls to event handler class via D-Bus, rather than executing file system actions directly
        - Potentially add verbosity argument to influence verbosity of wall_handler and console_handler
        - Ensure --help argument is supported
